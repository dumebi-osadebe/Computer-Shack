# Computer-Shack

Brief Summary: An interactive program to allow users to make natural language queries about available products at a given Computer Shack store

Computer Shack represents an online electronics retail store with a chain of physical stores. Their website includes a feature that allows a user to make natural language queries about available products. Ultimately, it should be able to interact with the system with statements like “Is there an Acer laptop at a store in Toronto that costs less than $500.”

The backend of the interactive system, which will be implemented in this project, will be using Prolog. It will include a knowledge base of predicates about each product, the stock available at different stores, the location of Computer Shack's physical stores and the locations where a product can be shipped. A defined dictionary of lexicons, queries to test the given knowledge base, and a parser will be used in addition to the knowledge base to implement this feature.

This project was completed using the XQuartz software available at https://www.xquartz.org/ .
